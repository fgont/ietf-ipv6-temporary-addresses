    <abstract>
    <t>
This document clarifies the stability requirements for IP6 addresses, and provides recommendations regarding the generation of non-stable addresses. Finally, it formally updates RFC4941 such that nodes are allowed to configure only temporary addresses.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
<t>IPv6 StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) <xref target="RFC4862"/> has traditionally resulted in stable addresses, since the Interface Identifier (IID) has been generated by embedding a stable layer-2 numeric identifier (e.g., a MAC address). <xref target="RFC4941"/> implies, throughout the  specification, that temporary addresses are generated and employed along with temporary addresses.
</t>

<!--
[RFC4941]:
   Addresses generated using stateless address autoconfiguration
   [ADDRCONF] contain an embedded interface identifier, which remains
   constant over time.


[....]

   1.  Do not result in any changes to the basic behavior of addresses
       generated via stateless address autoconfiguration [ADDRCONF].
-->

<t>While the use of stable addresses (only) or mixed stable and temporary addresses can be desirable in a number of scenarios, there are other scenarios in which, for security and privacy reasons, a node may want to use only non-stable address (e.g., a temporary address).</t>

<t>This document clarifies the requirements for stability of IPv6 addresses, such that nodes are not required to configure stable addresses. It also specifies a set of requirements for the generation of non-stable addresses. Finally, it formally updates <xref target="RFC4941"/> such that temporary addresses can be employed without the need to configure a stable address along side.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">

<t>This document employs the terms defined in <xref target="RFC7721"/>.</t>


<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>

<section title="Stability Requirements for IPv6 Addresses" anchor="iid-generation">
<t>Nodes are not required to generate addresses with any specific stability properties. That is, the generation of stable addresses is OPTIONAL. This means that a node may end up configuring only stable addresses, only non-stable, or both stable and non-stable addresses.
</t>
</section>


<section title="Requirements for Non-Stable IPv6 Addresses" anchor="non-iid-generation">
<t>The requirements for non-stable IPv6 addresses are as follows:
<list style="numbers">
<t>The resulting Interface Identifiers MUST be different when addresses are configured for different prefixes.  That is, if different
   autoconfiguration prefixes are used to configure addresses for the same
   network interface card, the resulting Interface Identifiers must be
   (statistically) different.  This means that, given two addresses, it must
   be difficult for an outside entity to tell whether the addresses have been
   generated by the same host.
</t>

<t>The resulting interface identifiers MUST NOT embed layer-2 identifiers (e.g. MAC addresses).</t>



<t>It must be difficult for an outside entity to predict the Interface
   Identifiers that will be generated by the algorithm, even with knowledge
   of the Interface Identifiers generated for configuring other addresses.
</t>

<t>The resulting Interface Identifiers must be semantically opaque and must not follow any specific patterns.</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>The IIDs of addresses configured for different autoconfiguration prefixes must be different, such that traffic for those addresses cannot be correlated.</t>

<t>The reuse of identifiers that have their own semantics or properties across different contexts or scopes can be detrimental for security and privacy <xref target="I-D.gont-predictable-numeric-ids"/> <xref target="RFC6973"/> <xref target="RFC4941"/>. For example, if two different layer-3 protocols generate their addresses by embedding a layer-2 identifier (e.g., a MAC address), then the traffic for such protocols could be correlated (irrespective of whether the aforementioned layer-2 identifier has been randomized or not). Besides, a node that generates an IPv6 address by embedding a link-layer address in the IPv6 address will, when configuring addresses for different prefixes, result in the same IID being used for such prefixes, thus allowing the corresponding traffic to be correlated.</t>

<t>For security and privacy reasons, the IIDs generated for non-stable addresses must not be predictable. Otherwise, the node may be subject to many (if not all) of the security and privacy issues that are meant to be mitigated (please see <xref target="RFC7721"/>.</t>

<t>Any semantics or patterns in an IID might be leveraged by an attacker to e.g. reduce the search space when performing address-scanning attacks, infer the identity of the node, etc.</t>
</section>


<section title="Generation of Non-Stable IPv6 Addresses" anchor="generation">
<t>One possible algorithm for generating non-stable IPv6 addresses is that specified in <xref target="RFC4941"/>.</t>

<t>Another possible approach would be to select a random IID when performing SLAAC. In this case, a node that disconnects from the network and subsequently reconnects would employ a (statistically different) IID for the same prefix. A different (random) IID should be employed for each autoconfiguration prefix. These addresses, as opposed to the temporary addresses specified in RFC4941, would be stable for as long as the node stays attached (without disconnecting) to the network, but would change when a node reconnects.</t>
</section>

<section title="Update to existing RFCs" anchor="updated-rfcs">
<t>The following subsections clarify how each of the RFCs affected by this document are updated.</t>

<section title="Update to RFC4941">
<t>The temporary addresses specified in <xref target="RFC4941"/> MAY be used in replacement of the stable addresses <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-default-iids"/>. That is, a node MAY configure temporary addresses only, without configuring any stable addresses.
</t>

</section>
</section>

	<section title="Future Work" anchor="future-work">
<t>This document clarifies the requirements for stability requirements for IPv6 addresses. A subsequent document will discuss the tradeoffs involved when considering different stability properties of IPv6 addresses, and and the different configuration setups such as: stable addresses only, non-stable addresses only, or mixed stable and non-stable addresses.

	<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana-considerations">
<t>There are no IANA registries within this document. The RFC-Editor can remove this section before publication of this document as an RFC.</t>
</section>



    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec-cons">
<t>This document clarifies the stability requirements for IPv6 addresses, and specifies requirements for the generation of non-stable addresses. Additionally, it formally updates <xref target="RFC4941"/> such that stable addresses are not required to be configured along with the temporary addresses.
